    <h2>Offence: X:Speed, Y:Preferred Attack</h2>
    <p>Cinderace was chosen as the best offensive fire type even tough it isn't the hardest hitter is because it is still a hard hitter and is the fastest fire type with an attack above 100</p>

    <h2>Defence: X-axis:Physical-Defence, Y-axis:Special-Defence</h2>
    <p>Reshiram was chosen as the best defensive fire type is because Ho-Oh is a pokemon that has a 4X weakness which makes it incredible weak, Reshiram doesn't have as good as a special defence as Ho-Oh but makes up for it in physical defence and typing</p>
