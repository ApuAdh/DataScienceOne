    <h2>There are some special cases, for example if you run the given code with flying or rock type you will see that Archeops dominates everyone in speed and attack even if they are all at the highest level, however Archeops has an ability that cuts all of his stats by 50% when his hp drops below 50%</h2>
    <h2>Another example is when you run the code with dragon type you will see that Dragapult isn't the hardest hitter, however Dragapult is much faster than all the other dragon pokemon in the graph and because the graphed poekemon were already filtered to be the strongest of the type his speed makes him the strongest in my opinion</h2>
