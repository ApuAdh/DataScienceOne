    <h2>Offence: X:Speed, Y:Preferred Attack</h2>
    <p>Barraskewda was chosen as the best offensive water type even tough it isn't the hardest hitter is because it is still a hard hitter and is the fastest water type with an attack above 100</p>

    <h2>Defence: X-axis:Physical-Defence, Y-axis:Special-Defence</h2>
    <p>Toxapex was chosen as the best defensive water type because just look at the graph, it absolutely obliterates every other defensive water type in the dust</p>
