    <h1 align="center">HOLYWOOD'S GENDER DIVIDE AND ITS EFECTS ON FILMS</h1>
    <H2 style="color:green" align="center">EXAMINING THE GENDER OF WRITERS,PRODUCERS,AND DIRECTORS WHO MAKE FILMS THAT FAIL THE BECHDEL TEST</H2>
    <p>There's this thing called the Bechdel Test. It measures just how male-dominated out beloved Netflix nights really are. To pass, films need to satisfy three requirements:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <ol style="font-weight:bold; display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
    <li>It has atleast two women in it</li>
    <li>Who talk to eachother about</li>
    <li>Something besides a man</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Its a low bar, but many good movies don't pass. <i>Birdman</i> fails. <i>Avatar</i> fails. Fucking <i>Toy Story fails.</i> On <a style="color:red" href="https://bechdeltest.com/">bechdeltest.com</a>, a site for crowdsourcing Bechdel Test results, about <b>40%</b> of films don't pass. It's a sad state because women exist in life, like, half the time.</p>
    <p>Why? Rather than generalize a sexist system, one theory is simple: filmmakers, unintentionally, make movies about themselves (i.e., write what you know). Since the most powerful producers, writers, and directors are men, male-themes permate into Holywood's output. To see if women are more likely to write about women(i.e., pass the Bechdel test), we compiled the gender of producers, writers, and directors on thousand of films.</p>
