    <h3>Let's wrap to the mid-90s, when labels began to play a new role in hip hop under the tutelage of Puff Daddy with Bad Boy and Suge Knight/Dre with Death Row.</h3>

    <p>In 1989, regional independent labels dominated with superstar signings: Young MC and the Pharcyde are signed to Deliciouus Vinyl. Biz Markie (Just a friend), Big Daddy Kane (Smooth Operator), and Marley Marl are all on Cold Chillin'. Ruthless, Eazy E's label, has N.W.A. and the D.O.C. on its roster. Jive is crushing it with a roster that includes Boogie Down Productions, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Too $hort. And Tommy Boy preciently released both De La Soul and Queen Latifah's first albums.</p>
    <p>Let's wrap to the mid-90s, when labels began to play a new role in hip hop under the tutelage of Puff Daddy with Bad Boy and Suge Knight/Dre with Death Row</p>
    <p>Beginning in '94, Bad Boy and Death Row began to compete with major labels for artists. Puff Daddy used his experience at Uptown and with artists such as Heavy D to launch Bad Boy, releasing rap albums with both underground and pop potential (e.g., Notorious B.I.G, CraigMack). Bad Boy's growth was followed by its feud with Death Row (Dre, 2pac), forever changing the role of labels in hip hop. Labels were not only the business-side of rap, but now a regional collective of artists who represent an identity and philosophy towards hip hop.</p>
    <p>During the mid-90s, a number of notable labels launched and gained notoriety:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ruffhouse Records</li>
        <li>Big Beat</li>
        <li>Loud Records</li>
        <li>Roc-A-Fella Records</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Today, <b>Young Money</b> is <i>dominating</i> with a lineup of Nicki Minaj, Drake, Tyga, and Lil Wayne.</p>

    <p>The weird thing is that it's only Young Money. For the past 25 years, there's always been mega-popular labels (e.g., Shady/Aftermath, Rawkus, No Limit, Bad Boy) - there were just more of them at one time. This is the current state of hip hop: Young Money has been the top label for each of the past five years. For the first time in hip hop's history, one label has had unprecedented influence. There's one sound and identity dominating the zeitgeist of hip hop. But Young Money's success has more to do with the evolving music industry. Artists don't need the big-budget marketing and distribution of major labels - they start with a grassroots social media following. In 2013, Macklemore famously avoided the label game all together, only signing a distribution deal. Chance the Rapper is still unsigned. Fetty Wap recently signed a deal with <b>300 Entertainment</b>, but it was only after he had a huge hit with Trap Queen. Instead of several, chart-dominating labels, hits are increasingly released by small, local labels (or even self-released). So labels are experimenting, trying to figure out how to stay relevant in a world that needs them less. Sometimes that means staying small. <b>XL Recordings</b>(Adele, M.I.A., FKA Twigs) is one potential model, who keeps its roster small and typically releases no more than six albums a year.</p>
