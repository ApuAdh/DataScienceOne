            <h5>This is a story about proving, with data, that <i>No Diggity</i> by Blackstreet is timeless.</h5>
            <p class="explanation">Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.
                <br><br>But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all of music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are fading into obscurity. And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.
                <br><br>20 years have passed since No Diggity's release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from the 90s, is a strong signal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine every song that ever charted, 1990 - 1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.
